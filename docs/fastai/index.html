Frank Rosenblatt, in Cornell, made some changes to the neuron model and had the idea to connecting them together to form a ‘perceptron’ machine. This machine was meant to be able to ‘learn’ without human programming.</p> <p>Along came Marvin Minsky from MIT, who said that actually, a single layer of these neutrons wasn’t capable of learning enough to simulate simple mathematical functions like XOR (a boolean operator). This was widely accepted and there was a loss of interest in neural-nets. However, what was not appreciated by the wider community, was that Minsky said adding another layer to the network was enough to simulate also any mathematical function.</p> <p>In the 1980s, MIT group of researchers came along with <em>Parallel Distributed Processing</em> (1986). They said that you could create something that could learn almost anything if you had a machine that dealt with:</p> <ul> <li>processing units;</li> <li>state of activation;</li> <li>output function;</li> <li>pattern of connectivity;</li> <li>propagation rule;</li> <li>activation rule;</li> <li>learning rule; and</li> <li>operating in an environment.</li> </ul> <p>Things that meet these requriements in theory could all sorts of work.</p> <p>In the 1990s, some institutions were using neural-networks to do things like credit scores. But the networks were rather unweldy and slow. Largely because they were not ‘deep’ networks. While it is theoretical shown that a network of only two layers of neurons could approximate almost any mathematical relationship/model, in practice, these networks were too big and slow. Other researchers had shown, to get good practical performance, you needed to add more layers of neurons to the network. Thus ‘deep’ refers to the use of many layers of neurons to boost the networks performance characteristics.</p> <p>Now with faster hardware, algorithms and data, we are at the point were we can realise Rosenblatt’s ambition.</p> <h3 id="software-stack"> <a href="#software-stack" aria-labelledby="software-stack" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Software stack </h3> <p>Software stack in use in the course: python -&gt; pytorch -&gt; fastai.</p> <p>Jupyter notebooks is a REPL that lets you execute code as well as output other things like markdown and graphics. So it’s a bit different to most development environments coders are used to.</p> <ul> <li>Here is the actual documentation for the web-gui version of <a href="jupyter-labs-docs">jupyter labs</a>.</li> <li>Fast AI book has a <a href="fast-book-jupyter-notebook-101">jupyter notebook 101</a>.</li> </ul> <p>There are two modes in Jupyter, ‘edit mode’ and ‘command mode’. Edit mode allows you to edit an individual cell. Hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">control-/</code> to add a comment. And hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shift-enter</code> to execute the cell. You are in editing mode when a flashing-cursor is present in a cell.</p> <p>Command mode is the other mode. It is not for editing individual cells, but lets you move around the notebook and do other things. There are quite a lot of short-cuts available.</p> <p>In the web-gui, you can input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">control-shift-c</code> to open the command palette.</p> <p>An important thing to remember is that when you execute a cell that runs code, that updates the state of the REPL. So lets say you set a variable to be the value 4. That means the REPL state has been updated and if you are to re-run any cell command that uses that variable, the starting value is going to be 4. When a cell is run and output is created, that output is the value of the expression at the time the cell was run. So if you later update the state or value, unless the cell is re-run, the cells output is not altered.</p> <h3 id="train-your-first-model"> <a href="#train-your-first-model" aria-labelledby="train-your-first-model" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Train your first model </h3> <p>Code for training the first model from the book.

How would you write such a program to do the training we have just done? How would you write a program that way that can recognise dogs from cats?</p> <p>Such a program seems very difficult to write.</p> <p>Athur Samuel (from IBM) circa 1940-1970 came up with an alternative, that he coined ‘machine learning’. He decided not to tell the computer the exact steps, instead he would show it lots of examples and let the program figure out how to solve the problem. He wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>“Suppose we arrange for some automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment in terms of actual performane and provide a mecanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maxize the performance. We need not go into the details of such a procedure to see that it could be made entirely automatic and to see that a machine so programmed would ‘learn’ from it’s experience.”</p> </blockquote> <p>‘Weights’ are variables and weight assignment is a particular choice of values for those variables. What Samuel called ‘weights’ we now typically called model parameters.</p> <p>Once we’ve done the training process, we take away the update/performance feedback loop and we have something like a traditional program that goes from input -&gt; model -&gt; output.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-neural-network"> <a href="#what-is-a-neural-network" aria-labelledby="what-is-a-neural-network" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> What is a neural network? </h2> <p>So, the type of thing we build the model from is super important. We want something general enough that it could really learn to recognise anything just by altering the weights (also called parameters to the model). That means whatever we construct the model from has to be super flexible. There actually is at least one such thing. That is a neural network. There is even a mathematical proof called ‘universal approximation theorem’ that shows this function can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory (the original Marvin Minsky discussion).</p> <p>So, we want to focus on finding the correct weights for any problem. What do we use to do that? How do we update the weights? There’s a thing called <em>stochastic gradient descent</em> that’s used.</p> <p>How do we know whether the model is effective? The performance is just the models accuracy at predicting things. Thus we held back 20% of the training data set to test the models predictions at each time we wanted to test the model before updating the weights.</p> <h2 id="limitations-of-machine-learning"> <a href="#limitations-of-machine-learning" aria-labelledby="limitations-of-machine-learning" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Limitations of machine learning </h2> <p>Do you have enough labelled data? You might have a lot of data but if the data is not labelled then how are you going to train your model?</p> <p>What happens if you show the model data it has never seen before? Like the dog, cat and banana. The model was not trained on bananas, so it’s parameters never feed into updating the model, so the models predictions are garbage.</p> <p>What is the data you have is bias? Say for policing, drug use is equivalent across race but police arrest more ethic minorities for drug offences than whites. If you give your model that data, and ask it for predictions of who will commit crimes, it will not correct the bias in the data.</p> <p>How can a model interact with it’s environment? If you begin with bias data and use that to drive actions that change the environment to be more like the model, then even if the environment was not bias to start with, you can make the environment more bias.</p> <h2 id="fast-ai-1"> <a href="#fast-ai-1" aria-labelledby="fast-ai-1" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Fast AI </h2> <p>The documentation for the fastai library is at <a href="fast-ai-docs">fast-ai-docs</a>.</p> <h2 id="chapter-1-questionnaire"> <a href="#chapter-1-questionnaire" aria-labelledby="chapter-1-questionnaire" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Chapter 1 Questionnaire </h2> <ol> <li> <p>Do you need lots of math/ data/ expensive computers/ a phd to use deep learning?</p> <p>No.</p> </li> <li> <p>Name fives area deep learning is now the best in the world.</p> <p>Lots of areas apparently.

This is true. But as soon as a second layer of neurons are added, the network can model any mathematical relationship.</p> <p>The second error was not using enough layers of neural networks. While 2 is theoretically enough, in practice, adding many more layers produces much better results.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is a GPU?</p> <p>A graphics processing unit.

The difference between a cat and a dog or a stool and an airport, are hard to describe if you had to use those concepts.</p> </li> <li> <p>What did Samuel mean by ‘weight assignment’?</p> <p>Weight assignment is the process of changing the parameters to a model to alter how the model transforms inputs to outputs. Weights are the variables that affect how to the model converts input to output. A weight assignment is just setting those variables to be some value.</p> </li> <li> <p>What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called ‘weights’?</p> <p>Parameters (to the model, itself is also called the architecture).</p> </li> <li> <p>Draw a picture that summaziers Samuel’s view of a machine learning model.</p> <p>Feed input to a flexible mathematical function that can replicate any mathematical relationship. The model begins with some predefined parameters that define how the function of that model transforms input to output. The input is run through the model. For each input through the model, the output is assessed and the result of this is feed into the model again by altering the weights. This processes goes on until we believe the model has learned enough to classify the input so it reliably gets the right classification/prediction for the output.</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>input -&gt; model -&gt; output -&gt; assessment

This makes it practically impossible for anyone to follow the evolution of the model, as it has to be done at super human speeds.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the name of the theorum that shows that a neural netowkr can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?</p> <p>Universal approximation theorem.</p> </li> <li> <p>What do you ned in order to train a model?</p> <p>Labelled data. Time. Computing hardware. A ‘model’ architecture. A way to determine the correctness of the output and how that will affect the learning rate of the weights.</p> </li> <li> <p>How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?</p> <p>Models, like computers, are dumb. They can only predict what they’ve seen before. If they have seen bias information, they will make bias predictions. Further, if the output of a model is collected as input data, then the bias will be further propagated into the model. A positive feedback loop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Do we always have to use 224x224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?</p> <p>Nope.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the difference between classificaton and regression?</p> </li> <li> <p>What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?</p> <p>We cannot consume all the labelled input data to train the model without risking producing a model that is overfit. Producing a feel fitted model is an art not a science. It requires a lot of tinkering. We need to prevent some of the input data from being exposed to the model during the training process so we can determine whether the model is overfit and what level of accuracy we think the model has reached (error level).</p> </li> <li> <p>What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set?</p> </li> <li> <p>Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?</p> </li> <li> <p>What is overfitting? Provide an example.</p> <p>You want to train a model to recognise humans. You run you model over and over again on the pictures of 10 people until it, instead of recognising people generally, only recognises those 10 people.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is a metric?
