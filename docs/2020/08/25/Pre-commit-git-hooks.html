You can distribute the hooks in the repository but you cannot enforce the (client-side) hooks use. example-code is available. Running a Git client-side pre-commit hook Git hooks allow you to hook into the pull/commit/push process that git is built around. A hook is useful if you want to extend or customise the behaviour of your repository. There are two types of hooks, server-side commits and client-side commits. Server-side hooks live on a git server (i.e. somewhere people push to, like a centralised github server). Client-side hooks live on each individual contributors development machine. Server-side hooks are a way you can enforce certain behaviours on the server. I’m not going to talk about them here. Instead, I’m going to look at client-side hooks. Have you ever wanted to run some sort of check on the code you are about to commit? You can do this with a client-side hook. However, one issue with client-side hooks is that they are not versioned in the git repository. I used to think this prohibited ‘distrbution’ of the client-side git hooks with the repository. Which sucks. Because, lets say you introduce a new developer to your repo, perhaps you’d like them to run the same checks as you do, they way you do. Traditionally, that’s not been possible with client-side hooks. However, there is a way (since git version 2.9). You need to configure the ‘hooksPath’. Setting up client-side hooks so everyone runs them In the root of your git repo, add the file .gitconfig with this content: [core] hooksPath = git_hooks When the repository is cloned, it points git to run hooks from the git_hooks subdirectory. Normally, git hooks are stored in .git/hooks, and that .git/ directory is not stored in the version-control (thus prohibiting distribution with the source-code). But with the (new as of git 2.9) hooksPath option, you can instead point to another directory in the repository that does store the hooks. However, git will not use the .gitconfig automatically. Apparently it’s a security issue (see stackoverflow-store-gitconfig). Instead, the user who has cloned the repository must explicitly tell git to use the .gitconfig. They only need to run this command once. I have it as a setup_repo.sh They can do that with this command git config --local include.path &#39;../.gitconfig&#39; This is an essential detail, if you want the distributed client-side hooks to run. Running something that changes the commit message Now you need to write a hook inside the git_hooks directory. I am going to write a hook that runs just before the user is asked to input a commit message. The hook is just a bash shell (though it does not have .sh as the filename suffix). If the shell exists with 0, the commit is allowed. Any other exit code blocks the commit. That’s how git hooks work. In your git repo, inside ‘git_hooks/’, create a ‘prepare-commit-msg’ file with the contents #!/bin/sh # Providing an environment variable override is helpful, if users need to by-pass your hook for some reason. # Set SKIP_HOOK environment variable if you don&#39;t want pre-commit tests. # Example: # &gt; $env:SKIP_HOOK=1 # &gt; git commit # &gt; $env:SKIP_HOOK=0 # The next 3 parameters are the parameters git supplies to the prepare-commit-msg hook.
