# Fast AI

## Practical deep-learning for coders

- At [course-fast-ai]. Using Google Cloud platform.
- There is a full book called [*'Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch'*]([deep-learning-for-coders-book-amazon]). It's actually available for free at [fast-book-git] in jupyter notebook form. Please buy a copy of the book if you enjoyed the course. 


### Compute

Recommended to use a cloud service for running jupyter notebooks, easier setup, reasonable cost etc. I decided to use Google Cloud Platform [google-cloud-console], because I already have an account. I haven't logged into it for about a year, and it's amazing to see how much progress Google have made to improve the UIX in that year. Well done Google.

Once you follow [these instructions](google-cloud-setup-instructions) to get an appropriate notebook available in Google cloud, you can [view your running instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/list/instances).

Make sure to stop your running instance once you've finished for the day. Otherwise, you will get billed for time you weren't using.
