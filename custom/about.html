        <p>Hi, I'm Donal. I'm a software engineer specialising in testing and verification. Welcome to my site. The content is largely about technology and my work. To help me remember stuff I've read or looked at, I'll post some content on the site.</p>

        <h2>Learn about it by building something</h2>
        <p>For me, the best way to learn is to understand the principles and then engage in practice. I have an open, inquisitive personality. So I like to learn by building something exciting. There are a lot of things I want to explore, but I only have a limited amount of energy. Sometimes there seem to be too many shiny things to explore. Sometimes, there doesn't seem to be enough. I think that learning and practing the fundamental tools, skills and ideas is the most important thing to do.</p>

        <h2>Be a finisher, don't start too many things</h2>
        <p>Because I love starting new things, I could tend not to finish what I start. But by sticking the stuff up here, I remind myself what I have previously started. So I'll finish them. Anyway, I like to build, learn and explain. Finding a solid learn/build/motivation feedback loop would be nice. Ultimately, I want to make things other people want to use.</p>

        <h2>Learn more programming, but primarily to build fun stuff</h2>
        <p>I'm want to become better at software development. I really enjoy it. Though, it can be somewhat solitary and doing it all the time can be a bit numbing. However, having read other programmers advice, it seems that wanting to build something is a key motivator. And also, learning a range of programming languages makes one a better programmer. Ultimately, being a great software developer but never making anything that anyone really wants, seems like a missed opportunity. And I don't think that's motivating.</p>

        <h2>Know your tools</h2>
        <p>Programming tasks really do favour specialists. Being OK at a range of things isn't a substitue for knowing one thing really well. I think a good programmer should be broadly proficient but have a clear specialism. And that specialism is pretty much the thing they earn money with. I know I'd rather be an expert in one small field than a decent generalist. I think quite a lot of programmers never actually make the decision to be specialised. I've narrowed my professional work to software testing and verification. I came across the function unintentionally but I got sold on the idea that it was hard to do well and important to do well. I don't like doing things that aren't challenging. So I find there's enough to make me stick around. Frankoly, there's a lot I don't understand about testing. Being a finisher means not leaving it until I've cracked the hard bits. My primary tool is Python, or at least, dynamic languages. I don't think there's much point occupying a functional niche (software test/verification) and not also occupying a tooling nice (e.g. Python). The problem with test and verification is that it's difficult, tricky and wide ranging. So to be good, you need to cover a lot of good. For instance, if you use a dynamic language to test a static language, how is that best done? </p>

        <p>This leads me to the importance of a developer understanding his toolkit. There is an army of different tools available, different languages, frameworks, products. But, how can you specialise without also specialising in a particular tool-set? And what would it mean to be a specialist in a toolkit? The tools themselves are significantly complex. Complexity, not understood, can save you time. But I also think complexity comes at some cost, and that cost often appears in unexpected places. Choosing, understanding, owning and customising tool-chains is an expensive investment. But, I believe it provides a worthwhile return on investment.</p>

        <h2>Automate the boring stuff</h2>
        <p>I got into software to make my life easier. There's a lot of boring stuff I have to do. If I can automate that with software, I've just made my life a little better. I think. A lot of the projects I engage in are about automating little parts of my life. Likewise, knowing and customising my toolkit helps make my life easier.</p>

        <h2>Become an expert in a problem domain</h2>
        <p>Software development serves a purpose. When we work on software, it's to solve a valuable problem. Bad software is often the result of failing to understand the problem well. The best way to create good software is to use software developers who understand the problem domain the software is for. A software developer should have any area of 'real-world' problems they work in. This is different to a functional domain within software development. A functional domain - like project management, feature development, testing, deployment - are activities present in any software development effort. It is not enough for a software developer to have a functional expertise without a domain expertise. We should all have a real-world domain expertise. For example, solving the problem of recording the flight of an airplane is different to the problem of using software to teach, or the problem of using software to record financial transactions. These problems represent valuable problems in significantly different domains.
        </p>

        <p>I am not currently aware of my domain expertise. It might be legal-tech. It might be something else. I shall have to see how this evolves over time.</p>
